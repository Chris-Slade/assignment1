  Assignment #1 - REMEMBER TO FOLLOW THE STYLE GUIDE

  1. Fork your own version of this repo
  2. Create a branch named <your-name>-assignment1 (in my case it would be mattbowytz-assignment1)
  3. Basing your code off of the below example, tell me a little bit about yourself

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

  <body>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

        I've used my browser's debugging tools to edit pages and make fake
        screenshots.

        I've written a few functions in JavaScript for interactive use.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've written some simple CSS styles for websites to do things like
        change the color scheme to something darker for nighttime reading, hide
        annoying elements, or replace ugly font choices.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've written some scripts that scrape web pages, parse the HTML, and
        extract content (e.g. one that scrapes a YouTube playlist and converts
        it to an M3U playlist file).
